This project utilizes EnyoJS (http://www.enyojs.com) and bibtex-js (http://code.google.com/p/bibtex-js/) to dynamically load and display pretty contents from a bibtex file.


To link PDF files, simply add 'pdf={file location}' to your bibtex enteries. Also to add publications that are to appear simple add 'toappear = {some non empty value}' to the bibtex enteries in question.
